	* plugin/nautilus-actions-utils.c: modify nautilus_actions_utils_parse_parameter ()

%? pattern which cause the quote bug (Bug #32)

	* nact/nautilus-actions-config.in: Fix display of the example string in

and add migration to the new folder (Bug #90)

from ~/.config/.nautilus-actions to ~/.config/nautilus-actions.

	* plugin/nautilus-actions-utils.c: modify nautilus_actions_utils_parse_parameter ()
to use nautilus_file_info_get_name() instead of gnome_vfs_uri_get_path () to avoid 
problem with url encoded filenames (Bug #84)

	* configure.in : add a --with-nautilus-extdir option to the 
./configure script. If this option is not used, it tries to use 
the pkg-config command. If the result is empty, ./configure 
write an error on the output asking to the user to
use the option to determine the path manually and exit.
