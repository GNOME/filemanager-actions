    Various code enhancements

        Gnome 3.0 requirements are met :
        - migrated from libglade to GtkBuilder
        - migrated from GnomeVFS to GVFS
        - gets ride of old dependancies

        - adds a dependancy on libunique 1.0
        - requires now Gtk+ 2.12, Glib 2.16

        Command-line utilities are now always built (no more a configure option).

    nautilus-actions-config-tool

         The configuration UI has been renamed from nautilus-actions-config.

         It provides more visual feedback : which actions have been modified, which
         are saveable or not, depending on their validity status. Automatically
         reloads the list of actions if it has been externally modified, depending
         on the modification status of the currently edited actions.

         Import and Export actions are now assistant-driven.
         Actions can be exported as a GConf dump entry (new format).

    nautilus-actions-new

         This utility has been renamed from nautilus-actions-new-config.

         It can be used to create an action, and has been updated to generate
         actions with the new export format, or to directly write the action into
         the GConf repository.

    nautilus-actions-schema

         This new command-line utility writes a GConf schema on stdout.
         Packagers may use it to install a schema.

Version 1.11.0 [unstable]

	Release date 2009-06-09

	This is the first intermediate release in the 1.11 serie.

	It includes a full rewriting of the action/profile object
	hierarchy, along with the system of change notification. It also
	introduces the new NactIIOProvider interface.

	The Nautilus plugin module, which actually takes care of selecting
	actions which will be displayed by Nautilus in item context menu,
	makes a full use of this new object hierarchy.

	The nautilus-actions-config UI always uses the old one.

Version 1.10.1
==============

	Release date 2009-05-29

	Nota:
		Last official release was 1.4.1 (05/2007) and is always available
		at http://www.grumz.net/?q=taxonomy/term/6/9 

		In the meantime (10/2008), some distributions have packaged and
		released the current state of the svn trunk (rev.510) ; they have
		generally called it 1.9 (sometimes 1.9b) ; this was _not_ an
		official release (though we can think it has been correctly
		tested ;-)) 

	Profiles
	
		The "profile" feature has been developed by Frederic Ruaudel
		(previous maintainer and original author of Nautilus-actions).
		It has been included in the intermediate version 1.9x without
		having thoroughly tested ; I have choosen to left it in this
		version to not create backward compatibility problems for the
		users of these distributions, but be warned : use with caution.
