- (Grumz) implement the Help button in nact (or hide it meanwhile)

- (Grumz) i18n doen't works in the command line tool and for some part
  of NACT like the scheme list, it seems..?

- Note about the schemas in Nautilus Actions:
  a) actions are identified by uuid
  b) so, all GConf keys have a path with the uuid of the action
  c) I'm not willing to write a schema for each and every uuid
  d) so, as of 1.11.2, the provided schema is general and should apply
     to all actions
  e) but there is not yet an API to set a GConfMetaInfo for a key
     note that gconftool-2 --dump is able to export for each entry a
     <schema_key> which includes the path to the general schema key
     but we cannot set it programatically (bad !)

- allow users to upload/download actions directly from a web repository
  (REST services ?)

- changing conditions in IConditionsTab should trigger an update of the
  example label

- propose a patch for GOptions so that the help for an option could be
  multiline (by defining an optional maximum width)

- open a bug against glib for g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()
  (see the 26 exported actions, and the screenshot of Nautilus view)

- open a bug against gnome-packagekit: keep the last window size and position

- gtk_tree_path_up returns TRUE even if there is no parent
  cf. commit 5ee6938486cd82f1274969506873df950348dd61 and before
  function nact-tree-model.c::add_parent
  recreate a small code which reproduces this bug and open in bugzilla

- lot of work to do on gconf editor

- for each toolbar, let the user choose which buttons are displayed

- make toolbars detachable

- make tabs moveable and detachable

- have a visual indication of the sort order in the tree

- use eggsmclient

- add -nounique option to not check for unicity (make easier to compare
  two versions)

- when a unique app is found, use libwnck (?) to activate it

- have a preference for modified and invalid fonts

- undo manager (at least Ctrl-Z)

- ui preferences: escape quit the assistant 
- ui preferences: warn on escape before quitting
- ui preferences: create root menu for background items
- ui preferences: add about item for background items

- nact_iconditions_tab_runtime_init_toplevel: use base_window_signal_connect
  and in all tabs

- check g_signal_emit_by_name TAB_UPDATABLE_SIGNAL_ITEM_UPDATED against
  its marshalling and against the signal definition

- have a single place where a schema is written
  (see src/utils/nautilus-actions-schemas.c)
  more: have a single place where the schema is _described_
  so that we may generalize export, import, new, etc.

- import/export menus ?

- IActionTab: check_label has became useless since validity is global
  to the action - remove, or extend to each field which can led to
  unvalidity

- action-new: add targets, folders, toolbar label

- data factory: put together each property of each elementary data (id, label, etc.)

- AssistantExport exports what it finds in Pivot, but should take its origin
  from current IActionsList (a. to have same perimeter than drag and drop and
  b. to export what we see)

- AssistantExport: report
  str->action = NA_OBJECT_ACTION( na_iduplicable_get_origin( 	NA_IDUPLICABLE( ia->data )));
  to gnome-2-28

- gtk_list_store_insert_before doesn't work ? see ibackground-tab::insert_new_row
