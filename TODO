Important things to do before next release :

- Create a command line tool to install a schema (wrapper to
"gconftool-2 --install-schema-file")
- Implement the Help button in nact (or hide it meanwhile)
- i18n doen't works in the command line tool and for some part of NACT 
like the scheme list, it seems.
- Add better error handling in import/export stuff of nact and some feedback to
user throught error dialog when import/export failed.
