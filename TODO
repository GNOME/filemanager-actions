- (Grumz) implement the Help button in nact (or hide it meanwhile)

- (Grumz) i18n doen't works in the command line tool and for some part
  of NACT like the scheme list, it seems..?

- Note about the schemas in Nautilus Actions:
  a) actions are identified by uuid
  b) so, all GConf keys have a path with the uuid of the action
  c) I'm not willing to write a schema for each and every uuid
  d) so, as of 1.11.2, the provided schema is general and should apply
     to all actions
  e) but there is not yet an API to set a GConfMetaInfo for a key
     note that gconftool-2 --dump is able to export for each entry a
     <schema_key> which includes the path to the general schema key
     but we cannot set it programatically (bad !)

- allow users to upload/download actions directly from a web repository
  (REST services ?)

- changing conditions in IConditionsTab should trigger an update of the
  example label

- GOptions request enhancement so that the help for an option could be
  multiline (by defining an optional maximum width)

- GLib bug for g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()
  (see the 26 exported actions, and the screenshot of Nautilus view)

- Gtk bug: Nautilus doesn't display the actions in the order of the provided
  GList in its context menu (seems as if a cache would keep the actions which
  were already here the previous time - to be confirmed)

- Gtk bug: gtk_tree_path_up returns TRUE even if there is no parent
  cf. commit 5ee6938486cd82f1274969506873df950348dd61 and before
  function nact-tree-model.c::add_parent
  recreate a small code which reproduces this bug and open in bugzilla

- GConf Editor request enhancement: one should be able to refresh the hierarchy
  (F5 ?)

- for each toolbar, let the user choose which buttons are displayed

- make tabs moveable and detachable

- have a visual indication of the sort order in the tree

- when a unique app is found, use libwnck (?) to activate it

- have a preference for modified and invalid fonts

- undo manager (at least Ctrl-Z)

- have a single place where a schema is written
  (see src/utils/nautilus-actions-schemas.c)
  more: have a single place where the schema is _described_
  so that we may generalize export, import, new, etc.

- IActionTab: check_label has became useless since validity is global
  to the action - remove, or extend to each field which can led to
  unvalidity

- export: add a overwrite page: what to do if file already exists ?

- nautilus-actions-new:
  give same defaults that when creating an action in NACT
  choose the target I/O provider

- NACT: unable to really delete an action imported with schemas
  2009-11-21 (2.29.2-provider) not able to reproduce this, whether the
  action is imported via Import assistant or by drag and drop from
  Nautilus

- Nautilus bug when dnd to nautilus on other screen
  see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=593453

- Nautilus bug: doesn't refresh toolbar when an item is updated

- nact: new action assistant

- DBus service: list current I/O providers

- DBus service: import/export an action or a menu

- optim: what about between base_builder_instance_init and
  base_application_v_initialize_default_icon ?

- enhancement.config: na_pivot_is_level_zero_writable:
  the provider which hosts the level-zero list of items should be a configuration option

- enhancement.ui: review statusbar layout
  do not add extra height to statusbar
  better encapsulate statusbar, lock indicator, possibly other indicators

- enhancement.ui: review toolbars layout
  so that detacheable toolbars do not take so such big extra space

- enhancement.management: we should be able to fully export a configuration
  this implies exporting menus and full tree

- enhancement.ui: rows implicitely selected should have a special display
  (as a sort of 'transparent' selection)

- nact-iactions-list.c: display_label
  the 'editable' cell property should be set only once, instead of at each redraw
  and more because we also compute this on selection change
  what we should do: compute once, and monitor to only change when needed

- Implement:
	Description
	SuggestedShortcut
	GetItemsList
	Path
	ExecutionMode
	StartupNotify
	StartupWMClass
	ExecuteAs
	ForEach
	OnlyShowIn
	NotShowIn
	Hidden
	TryExec
	ShowIfRegistered
	ShowIfTrue
	ShowIfRunning
	SelectionCount
	Capabilities

- Review:
	Mimetypes
	Basenames
	Schemes

- profile path and parameters should be set together as only one variable

- icon: is defined as localestring in desktop entry spec
  but path is defined as string in this same spec
  and icon may be a path -> so what to do with this ?

- try to restore hierarchy on import

- use NADataDef to automatically generate schemas
  in data/nautilus-actions.schemas.in
  and in src/utils/nautilus-actions-schemas

- before next release
  as it is probable that desktop files will not be ready
  -> join path and parameters

- note that iprefs ibackground-* has been renamed as ifolders-*

- in GConf, for v3, have conditions in a subfolder
  configurations/
    uuid/
       properties/
       conditions/
       profiles/
          profile-un/
            properties/
            conditions/
            command/

- see output to stdout: all data are written without profile name
