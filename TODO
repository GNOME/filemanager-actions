- Create a command line tool to install a schema (wrapper to
"gconftool-2 --install-schema-file")

- Implement the Help button in nact (or hide it meanwhile)

- i18n doen't works in the command line tool and for some part of NACT 
like the scheme list, it seems.

- na-action and na-action-profile are included in nact-window.h
  so are not needed in all other derived window files

- try to import a schema for an action (without schema)

- import and export assistants are seen as a distinct application in the
  task bar (there is a second NA icon) - gtk_window_set_transient_for()
  has no effect of this - open a bug ?
