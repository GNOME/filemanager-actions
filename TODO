- (Grumz) implement the Help button in nact (or hide it meanwhile)

- (Grumz) i18n doen't works in the command line tool and for some part
  of NACT like the scheme list, it seems..?

- import and export assistants are seen as a distinct application in the
  task bar (there is a second NA icon) - gtk_window_set_transient_for()
  has no effect of this - open a bug ?

- Note about the schemas in Nautilus Actions:
  a) actions are identified by uuid
  b) so, all GConf keys have a path with the uuid of the action
  c) I'm not willing to write a schema for each and every uuid
  d) so, as of 1.11.2, the provided schema is general and should apply
     to all actions
  e) but there is not yet an API to set a GConfMetaInfo for a key
     note that gconftool-2 --dump is able to export for each entry a
     <schema_key> which includes the path to the general schema key
     but we cannot set it programatically (bad !)

- allow users to upload/download actions directly from a web repository
  (REST services ?)

- NAUTILUS_ACTIONS_CONFIG_GCONF_BASEDIR has nothing to do in configure.ac
  (not a configuration variable)

- changing conditions in IConditionsTab should trigger an update of the
  example label

- use GtkUIManager
