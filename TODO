- Create a command line tool to install a schema (wrapper to
"gconftool-2 --install-schema-file")

- Implement the Help button in nact (or hide it meanwhile)

- i18n doen't works in the command line tool and for some part of NACT 
like the scheme list, it seems.

- na-action and na-action-profile are included in nact-window.h
  so are not needed in all other derived window files

- try to import a schema for an action (without schema)

- gtk_window_set_transient_for (see nact-conditions-editor.c) should be
  called in base_window_do_initial_load, but requires a parent window
  which should be passed as a virtual or in the constructor

- when importing multi-profile actions, profiles are not marked as modified

- reload actions : doesn't work ?? nothing appears in the ui
