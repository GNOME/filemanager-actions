- (Grumz) implement the Help button in nact (or hide it meanwhile)

- (Grumz) i18n doen't works in the command line tool and for some part
  of NACT like the scheme list, it seems..?

- Note about the schemas in Nautilus Actions:
  a) actions are identified by uuid
  b) so, all GConf keys have a path with the uuid of the action
  c) I'm not willing to write a schema for each and every uuid
  d) so, as of 1.11.2, the provided schema is general and should apply
     to all actions
  e) but there is not yet an API to set a GConfMetaInfo for a key
     note that gconftool-2 --dump is able to export for each entry a
     <schema_key> which includes the path to the general schema key
     but we cannot set it programatically (bad !)

- allow users to upload/download actions directly from a web repository
  (REST services ?)

- changing conditions in IConditionsTab should trigger an update of the
  example label

- propose a patch for GOptions so that the help for an option could be
  multiline (by defining an optional maximum width)

- open a bug against glib for g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()
  (see the 26 exported actions, and the screenshot of Nautilus view)

- bug: Nautilus doesn't display the actions in the order of the provided GSList
  in its context menu (seems as if a cache would keep the actions which were
  already here the previous time - to be confirmed)

- open a bug against gnome-packagekit: keep the last window size and position

- gtk_tree_path_up returns TRUE even if there is no parent
  cf. commit 5ee6938486cd82f1274969506873df950348dd61 and before
  function nact-tree-model.c::add_parent
  recreate a small code which reproduces this bug and open in bugzilla

- gconf editor: one should be able to refresh the hierarchy (F5 ?)

- for each toolbar, let the user choose which buttons are displayed

- make toolbars detachable

- make tabs moveable and detachable

- have a visual indication of the sort order in the tree

- use eggsmclient

- add -nounique option to not check for unicity (make easier to compare
  two versions)

- when a unique app is found, use libwnck (?) to activate it

- have a preference for modified and invalid fonts

- undo manager (at least Ctrl-Z)

- ui preferences: create root menu for background items
- ui preferences: add about item for background items
- ui preferences: default schemes

- have a single place where a schema is written
  (see src/utils/nautilus-actions-schemas.c)
  more: have a single place where the schema is _described_
  so that we may generalize export, import, new, etc.

- import/export menus ?

- IActionTab: check_label has became useless since validity is global
  to the action - remove, or extend to each field which can led to
  unvalidity

- data factory: put together each property of each elementary data (id, label, etc.)
  along with their methods

- export: add a overwrite page: what to do if file already exists ?

- na_object_id_get_topmost_parent: should it return a NAObjectItem ?

- nautilus-actions-new: write to GConf
