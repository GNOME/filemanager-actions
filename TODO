- Create a command line tool to install a schema (wrapper to
"gconftool-2 --install-schema-file")

- Implement the Help button in nact (or hide it meanwhile)

- i18n doen't works in the command line tool and for some part of NACT 
like the scheme list, it seems.

- Add better error handling in import/export stuff of nact and some feedback to
user throught error dialog when import/export failed.

- na-action and na-action-profile are included in nact-window.h
  so are not needed in all other derived window files

- try to import a schema for an action (without schema)

- see if we could define signals in base classes, and if this signals
  can be caught by interfaces - this would prevent us to define and
  call specific api (initial_load, runtime_init, etc)

- is it required to pass an action or a profile at initial_load ??
  (would be better only at runtime_init)

- gtk_window_set_transient_for (see nact-conditions-editor.c) should be
  called in base_window_do_initial_load, but requires a parent window
  which should be passed as a virtual or in the constructor
