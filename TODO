Important things to do before next release :

- Implement the notification stuff in n-a plugin
- Implement the signals in the libnautilus-actions gconf object
- Implement Import/export of Gconf schemas in Nact (make a wizard style
dialog and use the GObject of libnautilus-action like in the commandline
tool)
- Create a command line tool to install a schema (wrapper to
"gconftool-2 --install-schema-file")
- Add the option to set the actions in the background of nautilus
windows (already a patch ready in the bug tracker, probably need some
rewrite). Probably need to add some option in Nact.
- Implement the Help button in nact (or hide it meanwhile)
- Review the strings to make them coherent for i18n (eg, always use the
same case when referencing to Nautilus. Not 'nautilus', 'Nautilus',
'NAUTILUS', 'NaUtIluS', etc :)
- Rename 'New Action' by something more relevant like 'Manage Actions'
or 'Edit Actions'.
- Sort the gtk stock item in the dropdown list in nact edit dialog.
- Find why some stock icon are not rendered correctly in Nautilus (eg: gtk-edit,
gtk-info, etc.)
- i18n doen't works anymore in Nact.
