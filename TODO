N-A BUGS
========
- (Grumz, 2007 or before) i18n doen't works in the command line tool and for some part
  of NACT like the scheme list, it seems..?

- changing conditions in IConditionsTab should trigger an update of the
  example label

- when error on writing, should let the item modified

TODO
====
- 2010-06-20: is_candidate_for_show_in: get current environment

- 2010-06-17: implement shortcut button in NactIPropertiesTab page

- 2010-08-09: in v1.x until ??, %f used to be the basename!!

- 2010-08-12: NACT user's manual: review notes against tips:
  when do we should use each of them ?

N-A ENHANCEMENTS
================
- allow users to upload/download actions directly from a web repository
  (REST services ?)

- 2010-07-27: while editing a new filter, making it duplicate, try to keep editing
  instead of terminating the edition and letting the old value

- 2010-08-10: non-notification delay after save should be a preference

- 2010-08-09: na-pivot:st_burst_timeout should be a preference

- 2010-08-09: plugins should be able to provide a preference page

- let the user edit the current default schemes when adding from defaults for a #NAIContext

- 2010-06-17: ui enhancement
  all edition (entry, buttons, etc.) fields should have a small emblem when read-only.

- add a 'why this item is invalid'

- nact-iactions-list.c: display_label
  the 'editable' cell property should be set only once, instead of at each redraw
  and more because we also compute this on selection change
  what we should do: compute once, and monitor to only change when needed

- enhancement.ui: review toolbars layout
  so that detacheable toolbars do not take so such big extra space

- enhancement.management: we should be able to fully export a configuration
  this implies exporting menus and full tree
  + restore hierarchy on import (see bug 626337)

- enhancement.ui: rows implicitely selected should have a special display
  (as a sort of 'transparent' selection)

- enhancement.ui: review statusbar layout
  do not add extra height to statusbar
  better encapsulate statusbar, lock indicator, possibly other indicators

- enhancement.config: na_pivot_is_level_zero_writable:
  the provider which hosts the level-zero list of items should be a configuration option

- DBus service: list current I/O providers

- DBus service: import/export an action or a menu

- nact: new action assistant

- nautilus-actions-new:
  give same defaults that when creating an action in NACT
  choose the target I/O provider

- export: add a overwrite page: what to do if file already exists ?

- IActionTab: check_label has became useless since validity is global
  to the action - remove, or extend to each field which can led to
  unvalidity

- for each toolbar, let the user choose which buttons are displayed

- have a preference for modified and invalid fonts

- undo manager (at least Ctrl-Z)

- in GConf, for v4, have conditions in a subfolder
  configurations/
    id/
       properties/
       conditions/
       profiles/
          profile-un/
            properties/
            conditions/
            command/

- 2010-08-20: add an item in the context menu to explain why other actions
  are not displayed

OTHER ENHANCEMENTS
==================
- GOptions request enhancement so that the help for an option could be
  multiline (by defining an optional maximum width)

- GConf Editor request enhancement: one should be able to refresh the hierarchy
  (F5 ?)

- Nautilus: implement menu separator for plugins

OTHER BUGS
==========
- GLib bug for g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()
  (see the 26 exported actions, and the screenshot of Nautilus view)

- Gtk bug: Nautilus doesn't display the actions in the order of the provided
  GList in its context menu (seems as if a cache would keep the actions which
  were already here the previous time - to be confirmed)

- Gtk bug: gtk_tree_path_up returns TRUE even if there is no parent
  cf. commit 5ee6938486cd82f1274969506873df950348dd61 and before
  function nact-tree-model.c::add_parent
  recreate a small code which reproduces this bug and open in bugzilla

- Nautilus bug when dnd to nautilus on other screen
  see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=593453

- db2html: should create figures/ subdirectory
  and should not leave a nautilus-actions-config-tool.junk/ subdirectory
  to be confirmed against fedora13 before opening

- intltool: should implement standard targets for users
  (cf. 14.6 make.html GNU Make manual).
  As of 0.41.1, the absence of these standard targets prevents users
  (which are actually package developers) to provide any html, pdf, ...
  targets

- gnome-doc-util: should only distribute symlinks instead of plain files
  for missing translated figures

NOTES
=====
- Note about the schemas in Nautilus Actions:
  a) actions are identified by uuid
  b) so, all GConf keys have a path with the uuid of the action
  c) I'm not willing to write a schema for each and every uuid
  d) so, as of 1.11.2, the provided schema is general and should apply
     to all actions
  e) but there is not yet an API to set a GConfMetaInfo for a key
     note that gconftool-2 --dump is able to export for each entry a
     <schema_key> which includes the path to the general schema key
     but we cannot set it programatically (bad !)

- 20100408: gconf_concat_dir_and_key: have seen this as deprecated, but do not
  find again the reference :(
  not even in unstable library on the web
  http://library.gnome.org/devel/gconf/unstable/gconf-gconf.html#gconf-concat-dir-and-key

- "x-nautilus-desktop:///" is rather a scheme than a folder => actually is an URI

- default has changed for schemes (was coded as 'file' instead of '*')
  when version is recorded (as 1.4.1 or 2.0) then schemes is reliable
  when version is not recorded, it is a 2.30 serie, and scheme is not recorded when default (i.e. file)
  do not try to force anything than that, but this will have to be documented
