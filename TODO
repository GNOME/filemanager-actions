Important things to do before next release :

- Implement Import/export of Gconf schemas in Nact (make a wizard style
dialog and use the GObject of libnautilus-action like in the commandline
tool)
- Create a command line tool to install a schema (wrapper to
"gconftool-2 --install-schema-file")
- Add the option to set the actions in the background of nautilus
windows (already a patch ready in the bug tracker, probably need some
rewrite). Probably need to add some option in Nact.
- Implement the Help button in nact (or hide it meanwhile)
- Sort the gtk stock item in the dropdown list in nact edit dialog.
- i18n doen't works in the command line tool and for some part of NACT 
like the scheme list, it seems.
