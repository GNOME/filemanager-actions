docs
----
 As of FileManager-Actions 3.4, the documentation is composed of two
 main parts:

 - the Reference Manual describes all features of the product, rather
   targeting developers and packagers;

 - the FileManager-Actions Configuration Tool User's Manual.

 All the documentation, whether it targets users or developers, is made
 of architecture-independent files, and so default to be included in the
 distributed tarball.

Build system rationale
----------------------
 As all the documentation is distributed, the following rules apply:

 - default options do not build the documentation
 
 - because the packager is able to install the documentation from the
   distributed tarball, it is enough if only the maintainer is able to
   build this documentation

 - as a consequence, while the source build system must stay compatible
   with the oldest targeted distribution, the documentation build system
   may be more recent, as it will only be run on the maintainer
   development machine
