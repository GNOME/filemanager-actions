 maintainer
 -----------
 This directory contains some development tools which are expected to be
 used only by the maintainer.
 These tools are not distributed in the tarball, and are only present in
 git (that I use here as some sort of backup repository).

 Build system rationale
 ----------------------
 Documentation only includes architecture-independant files, and is thus
 fully included in the distributed tarball.

 - default is to not build the documentation

 - because the packager will be able to install the documentation from
   the distributed tarball, it is enough if only the maintainer is able
   to build this documentation

 - it is up to the maintainer to choose where to build the documentation:
   > either in the oldest targeted distribution
   > either in its own development machine.

   The first choice (the oldest system) might be more secure as it will
   embed in aclocal.m4 a version number compatible with all other systems.
   Contrarily, we are not sure that choosing the second option (the newest
   system) does not lead to some issues in older systems.

 - depending on the build tools version, the distribution may have to be
   build on the oldest or the newest system.
   For example, Debian 7 Wheezy (gtk-doc 1.18) requires gtk-doc to be
   enabled, while this is no more true with Fedora 24 (gtk-doc 1.25).

# in Debian 7 wheezy:
# apt-get install autoconf automake pkg-config gtk-doc-tools libglib2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libgtop2-dev libxml2-dev uuid-dev gnome-doc-utils libgconf2-dev dblatex libnautilus-extension-dev scrollkeeper

 Building the distributed tarball
 --------------------------------
 The whole process is managed by the 'run-distcheck.sh' script:

 - it first reconfigure (gtkdocize+autoreconf) the whole source tree
 - it then rebuild all sources and generates all the documentation
 - last it makes distcheck.

 Running
 -------
 G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=FMA gdb ./_install/bin/fma-config-tool
